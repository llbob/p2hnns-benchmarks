Benchmarking P2HNNS Algorithms
==============================
P2HNNS-benchmarks is a benchmarking environment for approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms. This website contains the current benchmarking results. Please visit P2HNNS-benchmarks to get an overview of the evaluated datasets and algorithms. Make a pull request on GitHub to add your own code or improvements to the benchmarking system. We acknowledge and give full credit to the original ANN-BENCHMARKS repository, developed by Martin Aumueller, Erik Bernhardsson, and Alec Faitfull, from which this project is forked.

This is currently a work in progress. We are still working on the documentation, the code and the results made available on https://p2hnns-benchmarks.com/.
